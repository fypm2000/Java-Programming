# Java-Programming

## Objective

The objective of this Java program is to facilitate a user-friendly interface for purchasing laptops. The program presents users with a menu of available laptops, allowing them to select one or more items for purchase. Upon selection, the program prompts the user to enter the quantity of the chosen laptop. It then calculates the subtotal for each line item, as well as the overall subtotal for the entire order. The program incorporates error handling by validating the user's choice within the proper range and providing appropriate feedback if an invalid choice is made. Additionally, the program calculates the tax and total cost of the order, ensuring accurate financial summaries. Finally, it generates an order summary displaying all purchased items, their quantities, prices, subtotal, tax, and total, providing users with a clear overview of their purchase.

- Implementing user input handling through the Scanner class.
- Performing mathematical calculations for subtotal, tax, and total.
- Constructing and displaying formatted order summaries for user convenience.

### Tools Used

- Java programming language for application development.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for coding, debugging, and testing purposes.
